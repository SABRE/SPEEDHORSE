        <span class="">J. Baxter Brinkmann’s extensive horse operation in Frisco, Texas, has been in business since the early 1980’s but has just recently begun building its industry profle through 275 head of horses bred, trained and sold for a variety disciplines. There are horses destined for cutting. There are other horses earmarked for halter. Some will become ranch horses. And still others are for racing. </span>

    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">Brinkmann’s extremely sizeable acreage is fve miles down the road from the former B.F. Phillips Ranch and, when the Phillips stock was dispersed, Brinkmann purchased several mares. The years passed and the mares went unproven. The greatest success story on the track came from Lavish Me, a 1992 mare who fnished second in the Speedhorse Sprint Futurity in 1994. She retired with $39,594 in earnings. </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">The Brinkmann picture began changing in 2007, when Dean Stermer climbed aboard as ranch manager. His special mission was to bring the horse program on-line. Stermer, in turn, brought in Greg Lofand as the on-premises trainer. He gathered other qualifed people, and with his team in place, breeding decisions for the race mares were put into motion.
