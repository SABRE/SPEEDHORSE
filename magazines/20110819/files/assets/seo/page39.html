      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Norman, OK—The heat wave across the Midwest forced Prairie Meadows to cancel races shortly after the first race was run on July 19 after jockeys voted not to ride.  The riders said the 97-degree temperature and 111-degree heat index made conditions hazardous to the horses. The Iowa track’s Thoroughbred meet runs through August 13, and the Quarter Horse meet is set to begin August 19 and to run through October 1. </span>

        <span class="">High Temperatures Causing Hardship Norman, OK—The recent 100 plus temperatures and drought conditions in many states across the Midwest have put additional stress on horse and cattle owners. Pasture for grazing has dried up and hay is hard to find.  Oklahoma’s Secretary of Agriculture is asking people with hay to register with the state so individuals can go to the directory on their website to locate hay. Many horse owners and ranchers have not been able to feed their animals, resulting in an increased number of horses and cattle at sales going for lower prices. </span>

        <span class="">Hendra Horse Deaths Reach 13 In Australia Norman, OK—Thirteen horses have died of the Hendra virus since June in Queensland and Northern New South Wales in Australia.  The latest death from the bat-borne virus suggests the horse may have had a previous Hendra infection and developed antibodies.  The case reinforces the suspicion that the virus can lie dormant in horses and people, and then emerge long after the initial infection. </span>
