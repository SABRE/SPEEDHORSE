        <span class="">True to his word, Carter qualifed Feature Mr Bojangles to the Rainbow with the third fastest time of :19.481 on July 8, approximately three weeks after the Four Corners. It was the sorrel colt’s frst foray into the 400-yard arena. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Carter was named to ride fve head in the trials. He qualifed four. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">It was a tough decision for the jockey but he felt a responsibility to ride fastest qualifer Mighty B Valiant in the fnals. With $507,000 in earnings, Mighty B Valiant had already helped Carter make some substantial bank deposits, so he opted for the You and Me Partners-owned colt for the July 24 race. Jacky Martin took the mount on Feature Mr Bojangles, allowing Sanchez and Dominguez to move from one proven veteran to the other. Martin and Feature Mr Bojangles walked into the three-hole and settled. Carter and Mighty B Valiant had the drop on the feld, charging out on the lead along the inside rail. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Mighty B Valiant appeared resolute in his quest for the $350,000 winner’s share and it seemed he was in excellent standing, fying toward the wire while Feature Mr Bojangles was drifting out in fourth. As noted, it was veteran-for-veteran, </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">with both riders knowing what to do to bring out the best efforts on their mounts. Feature Mr Bojangles seemed to move forward in inch-like increments, fnally putting a loop around Mighty B Valiant and lining out for the wire. He made it with 1/2-length to spare, over-throwing Mighty B Valiant who seemed weakened by the duel. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The Long Knife, breaking from the four-hole to become a challenger in the Rainbow, tried hard to lean on Feature Mr Bojangles for the win. The gelding made a strong push but still came up short. “Our colt stumbled coming out of the gate,” said Dominguez, “which is why he drifted. The four-horse, The Long Knife, had him by one-length at that point.” Feature Mr Bojangles has recorded three wins from four starts, with two of those in stakes, for $409,700 in earnings. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“He’s more than returned the $50,000 I paid for him at the Ruidoso Sale,” said Dominguez. “We’ve had a lot of offers to buy him since the Rainbow. We’ll probably think about some of them but we never want to sell more than 50-percent. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Jacky is one of those jockeys who’ll always tell you he doesn’t like to push a </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">horse unless there’s no other choice. For him, it doesn’t matter if he wins by two-lengths or a whisker. He won the Four Corners by a neck and that was good enough. Jacky says he’s out there to win and not to set a new track record. Roberto and I agree with him.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Feature Mr Bojangles entered the Rainbow fnals with a 100 speed index. That remains his high score. Catch This Dash, his 1996 dam, is deceased. She earned her ROM and then produced eight foals with six starters, all with their ROMs. Feature Mr Bojangles is the only stakes winner. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">In second was The Long Knife (Tac It Like A Man-Oodles Of Cash) owned by Stephen Denny, trained by Sleepy Gilbreath, ridden by Roy Baldillez. In third was Jess Sass Dash (First Down Dash-Jess Sass Me) owned by Desiree Princess Ranch, trained by Paul Jones, ridden by Cody Jensen. Remaining were Big Daddy Cartel (Corona Cartel-Miss Racy Eyes), Mighty B Valiant (Valiant Hero-Mighty B Doll), Jess Cuervo (Corona Cartel-Jessica Ravin), Bovet (Corona Cartel-Jess Genuine), Ym Quick (Valiant Hero-Also A High), Texas Rockstar (Feature Mr Jess-Elegant Elaine). </span>
