        <span class="">Me remained fifth at first call, but jockey Jennifer Schmidt soon made her move, urging the gelding into second place, which put him 1/2-length behind Six It Up as the betting favorite entered the stretch. Lien On Me had enough momentum left to surpass Six It Up, and cleared the finish line with a 1/2-length margin of victory. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Trainer Brent Clay saddled Lien On Me, who covered the 400-yards in 20.081 seconds and earned a $9,050 payday for owner Tom Pouliot. Ernesto Guerra Jr. bred both Lien On Me and his dam, Lenas Rare Lady. Pouliot also owns the 2003 mare, who posted three wins in 15 starts. Lien On Me is her only offspring. </span>

        <span class="">Clay also trains Six It Up (Tres Seis-Biddies On A High), who finished second for owner Steven Pribyl. Jockey Thomas Wellington did the riding. Seis It Fast (Tres Seis-Chic N Traffic) placed third by a 1 1/2-length margin for owner/ breeders Julie and Robert Petersen. The Edward Hardy trainee had jockey Doug Frink aboard. The remaining order of finish was Lisa Packen (Pistol Packin Perry-My Big Time), Dangerous Guns (The Corona-Garters N Guns), Its a Jazzin Time (Jazzing Hi-My Big Time) and Pithia (PYC Paint Your Wagon-Miss Eyewear), who reached the wire fourth but was disqualified to last place for interference while leaving the starting gate. </span>

        <span class="">Jess A Runner wasn’t just another competitor in the Great Lakes Stakes. Not only did he win the $17,150 stakes on July 24 at Canterbury Park, he broke a seven-year-old track record at 440-yards, covering the distance in 21.162 seconds and registering a scorching 119 speed index. Capones Vault held the previous record, a 21.695-second run set on July 3, 2004. Kenny Laymon trains Jess A Runner, and shook up the five-year-old gelding’s regimen heading into the Great Lakes by swimming him on a regular basis. It apparently worked. </span>

        <span class="">After breaking second out of the four-hole, Jess A Runner grabbed a one-length lead at first call. Jockey Doug Frink brought the gelding into the stretch enjoying a </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">1 1/2-length cushion. That, however, apparently wasn’t enough for the gelding, who bolted away from the rest of the field to win by a commanding three-lengths. Owned by JK Running Horses LLC, Jess A Runner now has seven wins in 21 career outs. His lifetime earnings increased to $142,374 with this $8,575 addition. That includes three victories in stakes company. Jess A Runner finished first in a pair of graded stakes at Prairie Meadows last season. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Paul Newmaster bred Jess A Runner out of the 1999 mare Katiebug Driver, whom he also owns and bred. Of the five starters produced by Katiebug Driver, two hold black type. Pretty Girl Kate, a half-sister to Jess A Runner, won the 2007 Kansas Bred Derby. </span>

The Charley Hunt trainee had jockey Jennifer Schmidt aboard. Behavin Cartel (Southern Cartel-Love Miss Behavin) placed third.
