        <span class="">seems to be the way he prefers to do things. I’m telling you, this is a danged nice horse.” There was a time, about a year ago, when Gilbreath didn’t feel quite as confdent about the horse. Back then, it was Jacky Martin who kept telling the veteran trainer that Cold Cash 123 was a runner. The gelding closed the huge gap in the Rainbow fnals, passing everyone until he blazed across the wire with a neck verdict. It wasn’t a huge margin but it didn’t change the numbers on the $449,762 paycheck. He’s now earned $513,246 with a 5-1-0 record from nine. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">And he’s done it all for “these dinky people from up north.”  Those words came from Carolyn, who brings the term “humble” to a new height….or maybe it should be a new low. “This is a dream,” she said, “and we’re living it. I can’t even explain how it feels. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“This is a laid back horse, with nothing fancy-prancy about him. Roy said he just let him run his race and, really, that’s what Cold Cash always does. He’s never hooked up with anyone. He’s just always out there on his own. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“The really unbelievable part of the story is that we raised him; we own his dam and grandam.” </span>

        <span class="">The Bays purchased Very Striking from Doc and Barb Conley, who actually established the line’s foundation. They later added To Hot To Hug to their stable. Still later, the Conleys gave them their foundation mare Lou Etta Deck. To Hot To Hug, when bred to Takin On The Cash produced Hot Cash 123. Also heavily involved in Paint racing in Michigan, Carolyn bred Hot Cash 123 to Judys   continued on page 58 </span>
