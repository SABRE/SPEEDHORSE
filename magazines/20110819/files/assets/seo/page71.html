        <span class="">Lil Bitts A Dash has some history with the Bitterroot. The three-year-old gelding was third in the Bitterroot Futurity in 2010 when it ran at Pocatello Downs. The Patterson Livestock-bred runner spent his two-year-old season in stakes company, with the exception of his frst out in a maiden. By the end of 2010, he had three wins under his belt from eight attempts and $14,275 in the bank. His third-place fnish in the Bitterroot was as close as he came to that elusive black type, but he’d already demonstrated he had some speed with two 104 speed index fnishes and his connections looked forward to a promising sophomore campaign. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Lil Bitts A Dash came off eight-months of down time to win his frst out in 2011 decisively. He stepped onto the Pocatello Downs track for the Spring Classic Stakes on May 7 and fnished 1 3/4-lengths out. Unfortunately, he failed to light the board in the fnals, but the season was new and he still had a full dance card. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Trainer Jake Newbold hauled Lil Bitts A Dash to Jerome, Idaho, for his next out where the gelding fnished second with an impressive 103 speed index in his frst </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">attempt at 400- yards. The distance agreed with him and owners Cassady Whittaker and David Newbold gave the nod for the Bitterroot trials on July 9 at the newly reopened Les Bois. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Lil Bitts A Dash won his trial heat with a 1 1/4-length gap in :19.615 for a blistering 107 speed index. It was small wonder the betting public sent him off the boards as the overwhelming favorite for the fnals on July 23. Jason Packer, who had been in the irons for the four previous starts, was once again on top for the $24,720 fnals. He guided the favorite into the two-hole on a fast track. Lil Bitts A Dash broke on top and never looked back. He took an early 1/2-length lead and maintained it throughout most of the 400 yards before kicking it into high gear. He was 1 3/4-lengths to the </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">good when the clock stopped at :19.776 for another 104 speed index. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The $9,888 winner’s share of the purse jumps his bankroll to $27,371 with a 6-2-1 record from 13. The Bitterroot Derby was his frst stakes title. </span>

        <span class="">The remaining order of fnish was First Te Fame (Darkelly-Third Pass Ta Fame), Corona For Tony (Corona For Me-Alibi Fame), Dashin Corona (Corona Cartel-For The Better), JW Next To Last (Call Me Corona-Tayllores Shuffe), Special Truth (Special Leader-Nothin But The Truth), and JW Chicks Cutie (Looking For Chicks-Baby Got Cash).
