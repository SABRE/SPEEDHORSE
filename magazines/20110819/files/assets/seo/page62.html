        <span class="">Odds-makers and those placing wagers thought so highly of Denver Pass that the colt was the favorite at post time for the Rainbow Juvenile Stakes. By the time the $20,000 event concluded, Denver Pass had met those expectations—just barely. After breaking out at the start of the 400-yard race, Denver Pass had to make a late surge and beat longshot Escort West to the wire by a head to claim his second win in three career outs and his first in stakes company. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Home-bred by owners Weetona Stanley and William Smith, Denver Pass has yet to finish worse than third in any of his starts. That one third-place finish came in the Rainbow Futurity trials. Though the colt didn’t qualify for the finals, he did enter the Rainbow Juvenile as the 5-2 favorite. Saddled by trainer G. Blane Wood, Denver Pass emerged from the four-gate running fourth. Despite breaking wide, the </span>

    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">colt remained third both at first call and as he went into the stretch. The colt shifted into a strong surge and, as he did, then-leader Viva Arriba faded. There was plenty of running room for Denver Pass to reach the wire first by a head. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Jockey Jacky Martin was aboard for the stakes-winning trip, completed in 19.899 seconds for an 87 speed index. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Next up for Denver Pass is trials for the All American Futurity. </span>
      </p>

        <span class="">Denver Pass joins his dam, First Carolina, in black type. The 2004 mare claimed two stakes wins during a career </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">that brought in more than $400,000 in prize money. Stanley and Smith also own and bred the mare, who has produced two starters out of three total offspring. </span>

        <span class="">Escort West (Fly Jess Fly-Chain Of Fools) had a bumpy ride but still finished second. Dream Walkin Farms owns the gelding, </span>

        <span class="">trained by Luis Villafranco for jockey Gaspar Garcia. Lotta Love For Robyn (First Down Dash-Love Ya Miss Jess) took third by a nose. Wayne Barton is the owner and the John Bassett trainee had jockey Saul Ramirez Jr. in the irons. The remaining order of finish was Viva Arriba (PYC Paint Your Wagon-Arriba Reba), Priceless Feature (Feature Mr Jess-Southern Price), Mighty Famous Vic (Mighty Invictus-Fame Us Katie), Stolis Rogue (Stoli-Hug A Rogue) and Cadillac Cartel (Corona Cartel-Jessie Rae). Feature Zoe and VGC Moon Walk scratched. </span>
