        <span class="">Les Bois was open once again and she traveled back to Idaho for the $103,453 Bitterroot Futurity RG3. Winning was becoming a habit with her and the new surface at Les Bois agreed with her. She took her trial heat by a length in :17.312 for a 110 speed index at 350-yards. “We planned to space her races out a bit more,” said Weigt, “but one of the races got pushed back and that jammed everything together. She didn’t get the break we wanted, but she’s a really tough flly. A lot of times she comes off the track not even breathing that hard, but I still don’t like pushing babies. We watch her very closely and she always bounces right back, like she’s ready to go again the next day. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“I was glad to see Les Bois reopen and they did an excellent job getting the track ready. Some people came in from California to resurface it. I heard they hauled in 500 loads of sand, mixed bark with it then started wetting it down. It made a fantastic surface. Illtacmanhattan loved it. It was like she was gliding across the top.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">July 23 was a perfect racing day in Les Bois. The track was fast. There was a fve mph tail wind and the fans lined up to see the Double Bar S Ranch-bred, undefeated flly try to win again in her toughest race to date. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Regular jockey Nikeela Black was aboard. She guided the flly into the three-hole and looked down the vee. Illtacmanhattan broke on top and was 1/2-lengths to the good at frst call. Second favorite, SW Count On Me, made a run at her, but Illtacmanhattan extended her advantage. The gap narrowed to 3/4-length at the wire, where she stopped the clock at :17.291 for another 110 speed index. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The $41,381 share of the purse brings her winnings to $86,018 with a 7-0-0 record from seven. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Illtacmanhattan is one of those fllies every trainer wants,” said Monty Arrossa. “She has a big attitude and she wants to do things on her terms, but she’s also very aggressive and loves to run. She’s happiest when she’s on the track and she always has a lot of go in her. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“I watched her sire run (Tac It Like A Man) and I liked him. That doesn’t always translate when they go to stud, but I had high hopes for his babies and I wanted to get one for Denny (Weigt) if we could. We went to the sale and she came in on the second day. It was really hard sitting on our hands that frst day. There were some good colts going through the ring, but I knew we had to be patient and try to get the flly. We weren’t the only ones looking at her, </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">though, and I was worried we wouldn’t get her after letting some other good prospects go by while we waited. Patience paid off for us and we got her. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Nikeela gets a lot of credit for how the flly runs. She always gallops her and rides her. They kind of have an understanding and just ft each other. I’ve been really blessed to have a good team. My family helps a lot. I have a great assistant trainer and my grooms are top notch. A trainer can’t do much without a great team and I have one. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Illtacmanhattan will go on to the Challenge at Los Al and the Pacifc Coast Futurity and that’s it. She’ll go out for a well-deserved break.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“This has been a fun year,” said Weigt. “She’s the leading horse by races won in the nation. My birthday was on May 1 and I told Monty all I wanted was a win in the Beehive. He called me on April 30 after the trials and told me I had my birthday present. She won her trial heat and we were going on to the Beehive fnals. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Monty’s crew takes such good care of all the horses. They take them out of the stalls morning and night to brush them and clean their stalls. You never fnd anything out of place at his stables. It’s always spotless, as are the horses. It’s hard to fnd a trainer who takes better care of a horse and works with them to get their best. Monty told me he really wanted a Challenge buckle. In the Challenge races, the owner gets a buckle for winning the </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">trial heat and then, in the fnals, the owner gets a bronze trophy and the trainer and jockey get buckles. Monty got his buckle, now I’d like to see if he can get another one. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“I never keep horses after their two-year-old year, so as much fun as Illtacmanhattan is to own, she’s for sale. We have some people looking at her now and waiting on x-rays. We’ll take her to her next races and she’ll move on to new owners and hopefully go on to make a nice broodmare.” Illtacmanhattan is out of 1999 model A Tiny Bit More (Strawfy Special-Tinys Rose Bud, Tinyes Gay) who had a 1-1-0 record from four and $6,182 in earnings. She has six foals of racing age with fve performers. More Than You Know is her leading money earner with $133,169. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Finishing second was SW Count On Me (Count Corona-Raise A Rhoda) owned by Wright Brothers Ranches LLC, trained by Monty Arrossa and ridden by Tony Guymon. In third was Veyron (Ivory James-Leading Diva) owned by Travis and Wendy Saxton, trained by Bret Vickery and ridden by Paul Greene. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The remaining order of fnish was Fly Chet Fly (Fly Jess Fly-Rarest Of Rare), Tac Da Chicks (Tac It Like A Man-Chicks On Fire), Micky Rush (Red Hot Rhythm-Ryans Rhythm), Moven Katielane (Maknmoves-Katie Lane Finder), Jess Fly Rey (Fly Jess Fly-Disco Del Rey), and Stolen Cartel (Corona For Me-Stolen Diamonds). </span>
