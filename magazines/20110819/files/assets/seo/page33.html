He gained a one-length comfort zone in the early going and held it over the wire. He earned $38,393 for a career total of $244,647. He’s won fve-in-a-row, including two graded stakes. Earlier in the year he was second in the Oklahoma Derby. His lifetime record is 6-2-1 from 12 with a 108 speed index. He’ll rest until the trials for the Texas Classic Derby at Lone Star. Sills’ name is a familiar one in stakes circles. He breeds approximately 50 percent of his runners and buys the other 50 percent. “Sure, it’s especially satisfying </span>
