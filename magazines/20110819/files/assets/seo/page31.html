        <span class="">Find Me A Hero drew the one-hole for the July 23 Speedhorse fnals at Fair Meadows. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“I was disappointed to have the inside,” admitted Lofand, “but I felt much better after several people told me horses were winning from the rail. Our colt was still green but we felt he had an excellent chance.” Some folks may wonder why a March 14 two year old would still be green on July 23. It goes back to the patience that Lofand mentioned earlier. “He didn’t need time to mature physically,” said the trainer, “but he did need time mentally. We didn’t want to send him out there before he was ready. We didn’t want to risk it.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">With Ives back in the irons, Find Me A Hero made an alert break in the fnals and began tackling the 350-yards in second. He was working against rivals who had three or four starts to his one, so he was battling against more experienced runners. Hank Song left on the lead from the seven-hole, while Find Me A Hero dropped from second to third. The colt was still third when Haulin Candy Salt, who left from the fve, pulled up even with Hank Song. Hank Song held his place in what became a three-way duel but began losing ground in the fnal yards. Haulin Candy Salt seemed suspended in second, allowing Find Me A Hero to take advantage of Hank Song’s fade. Find Me A Hero jumped to the front just before the wire, winning by a neck and handing over a $146,312 check to the Brinkmann team. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“He’s paid into the Dash For Cash,” said Lofand, “but we’d also like to take him to Zia. He’s a mild-mannered colt, </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">with really kind eyes. It’s been a lot of hard work to get him to a graded stakes level in just his second start and it could never have happened without the entire ranch team.” Prior to Find Me A Hero, Lavish Me’s leading money-earning offspring was the 2005 Feature My Jess with $15,000. The mare has 12 foals with eight starters. All have their ROMs with Find Me A Hero the frst, and only, stakes winner. In second was Haulin Candy Salt (Pyc Paint Your Wagon-Salt Lake Spitty) owned by Carl Pevehouse, trained by Clint </span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Remaining were Hank Song (Jumpn Chic-Valuable Gal TB), Ease Bye (Azoom-Jess Easy), Rekles Chic (Jumpn Chic-La Gallas Reckless), Trick On The Run (Pyc Paint Your Wagon-Trickie Lassie), Paint Me Quickid (Pyc Paint Your Wagon-Rustys Quickid). Dark Ivory Storm and Second Painted Sign were both trainer scratches. </span>

        <span class="">By Diane M. Ciarloni </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">Most of us have heard the adage that tells us, “All good things come to those who wait.” If anyone doubts the veracity of those words, just take a close look at Capo De Capi. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Bred by P.K. Thomas/Kim Kubinski and owned by James Sills, the three-year-old bay colt never ran a really terrible race as a freshman but neither was he a headline-maker. He earned only $42,783 from fve starts but the numbers never discouraged Sills. And trainer Eddie Willis never doubted the talent he felt he spotted when the colt walked into the Heritage Place sale ring. “I wasn’t even at the sale,” said Sills. “I trust Eddie completely and he was the one who bought the colt. We always knew he could run, that he had the speed, but things just worked against him last year.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The most signifcant thing working against him was his shins. They sored up early and he could never shake the problem. He </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">gave all he could in his fve freshman starts but those shins kept him short of 100 percent. Capo De Capi’s fnal start last year was on Halloween at Will Rogers Downs in a futurity trial. He was sixth. Willis broke training for the colt and gave him more than four months of R and R. What happened during that hiatus was amazing. The colt’s frst effort in 2011 </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">was March 6 in trials for the Oklahoma Derby. He fnished third, qualifed, and was second in the fnals. He looked good and there was no trouble from his shins. Willis tweaked and tuned on the colt and then sent him out on April Fool’s Day in a 300-yard allowance.  </span>
