        <span class="">Legendary trainer Jack Brooks had a barn crammed with horses when he decided to retire. Horses and their owners always came frst with Brooks, and he wanted to be certain he found excellent “homes” for everyone. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Brooks pulled out his phone and began calling trainer colleagues. One of them was Sleepy Gilbreath. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“He said, ‘Sleepy, you just have to take some of these horses,’” recounted Gilbreath. “I told him I couldn’t handle any more. ‘Besides,’ I said, ‘I couldn’t train for some of the people you train for.’” A few days passed and Brooks called again. This time, he told Sleepy that he had someone he</span>
        <span class="">
          <I> must</I>
        </span>
        <span class=""> take. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“He told me they were the best people in the world,” continued Gilbreath. “And I tell you, I’ve never regretted taking them, not even one time. That lady loves her horses and it doesn’t matter which breed.” And that’s how Carolyn and Walt Bay of Michigan (T Bill Stables), along with Cold Cash 123, hooked up with Gilbreath. Carolyn grew up with horses, with both her paternal and maternal grandfathers match racing on the Saginaw River. There’s a picture of her at three on a horse and there’s another one of her at fve, sitting on a horse and watching her grandfather round up cattle. She studied animal science in school and, as far as horses are concerned, she’s “ridden them, showed them, judged </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">them and raced them.” It’s diffcult to become any more involved. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Even with all her passion and interest, though, Carolyn and Walt didn’t have their frst graded stakes winner until November 28 of last year when their homebred Cold Cash 123 won the G1, Southwest Juvenile Championship. (He won the All American Juvenile two months earlier.) The Bays were thrilled and probably would have been content to stop right there. Cold Cash 123, however, had far bigger ideas. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">After the Southwest, Gilbreath decided the bay gelding was ready for a rest, taking him out of action until May 8, 2011, when he fnished ninth in a derby trial at Remington Park. His connections were hoping for a better performance in his frst derby start but his chances fell to zero after being banged around. Instead of going after a lost cause, Jacky Martin wrapped up and saved the horse for another race. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Two months to the day passed before the gelding lined up on July 9 for the G1, Rainbow Derby trials. He and Roy Baldillez, who was riding Cold Cash 123 for the frst time, moved into the three-hole. The gelding jumped into motion immediately but broke to the outside. He </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">was running a heart-breaking ninth but he was also moving steadily toward the front. He fnally overtook his rivals and fnished the trip with a stunning 2 1/4-length margin, with the fastest qualifying time of :20.762 and a 106 speed index. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Baldillez was back on Cold Cash 123 for the July 23 Rainbow fnals, with the gelding </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">stepping into the nine-hole. Across the track, in the one-hole, was Texas Classic Futurity winner Bodacious Dash. Bodacious Dash couldn’t wait to display the talent that brought home the trophy from the Texas Classic. He was out of the gate under Ricky Ramirez and took an immediate lead. While this was happening, Cold Cash 123 was in sixth, then dropped to eighth. The track was sloppy with a fve mph head wind. No one has ever gotten after the gelding with a whip and Baldillez wasn’t about to be the frst. Instead, he fagged Cold Cash 123 a couple times and let him play things out on his own. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“The horse on the inside (Bodacious Dash) ran a huge race,” said Gilbreath, “and out-footed him away from the gate. He had to run them down and catch them, which </span>
