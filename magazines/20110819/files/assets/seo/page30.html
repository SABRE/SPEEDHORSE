        <span class="">clock began ticking for Brinkmann’s return to the racing industry, working according to a laid-out program that would allow the Brinkmann team to produce results that would be a credit to racing. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“We bred 70 mares in 2008,” said Sterner. “They were all embryo transfers and we ended up with 69 foals in 2009. We bred them to some good stallions but our problem was that they were unproven. That means the babies were worth very little in a sale ring. Twenty of those 69 were racehorses, so we made the decision to run them ourselves. We have 15 in training right now. I like to think of them as our secret weapons.” Perhaps Stermer’s favorite out of the 20 is the one he refers to as “the big, black colt.” His name is Wicked Hero and he, too, is by Valiant Hero. Wicked Hero was in the Speedhorse trials but fell to his face leaving the gate. Fortunately, he walked off the track with no injuries. Brinkmann horses seldom leave their home turf for anything other than competitions. They’re born there, broke there and trained there. There’s a track. Most of their feed is also grown there and two veterinarians attend to their physical needs. In other words, it’s a self-contained facility that gives undivided attention to its objectives. “Mr. Brinkmann owns a share in Valiant </span>

        <span class="">Hero,” explained Stermer, “so that’s where we decided to go with Lavish Me.” So far, this tale sounds as if Brinkmann is starting, or re-starting, from scratch. But you never know what to expect in the horse industry and, as it turns out, the ranch was actually building on its past. Remember, Lavish Me was second in the Speedhorse Futurity in 1994. On July 9 her foal, a colt named Find Me A Hero, made his frst career start in the trials for the G2 Speedhorse Gold and Silver Cup Futurity. The March 9 colt stumbled out of the 10-hole, fnished second by a neck and qualifed with the eighth fastest time of :17.745. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">To say Find Me A Hero was green is a giant understatement. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“We want to be patient with our two year olds,” said Lofand, who trained with Heath Taylor for four years, “because we want to have sound three year olds. One of our main goals is to come with more than just one good runner. We want it to be a continuing, quality program.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Lofand didn’t begin training until he was 32, just six years ago, but he has a </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">considerable background in racing. His father trained at the early bush tracks and Lofand was around a great deal of the </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">time. He developed an eye for recognizing potential talent and he’s currently putting it to outstanding use. “Find Me A Hero was extremely studdy when we were breaking him,” said Stermer. “I feel like he’s a phenomenal individual. He’s built like a racehorse should be built, plus he’s unbelievably good-looking. We spoke with a halter trainer about him and he said he could go into a halter class right now and win. You never know what will happen but we’d certainly like to get some halter points on him, and maybe try for a Supreme title. “I’m a professional steer wrestler. We like to keep our horses collected and gathered, which was Find Me A Hero’s problem in the Speedhorse trials when he stumbled away from the gate. We refned a few things after that and he was much, much better in the fnals.” </span>
