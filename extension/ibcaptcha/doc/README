1. General
--------------------------------------------------------------------
IB Captcha is an extension that allows you to protect your site from
spam robots.


2. Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using IB Captcha you can protect user registration, adding comments,
topics in the forums, feedback forms, etc..
After activating IB Captcha extension a new IB Captcha datatype will
become available. After adding this datatype to 'protected' classes
you can set these parameters for each class:
- Security code word length (in symbols)
- Symbols those will be used for generating security code: letters,
numbers or letters and numbers
- Width and height of the image, which shows the security code
- The level of noise and color (circles, which are displayed over the background)
- The background color and character security code.
- Users who do not need to enter security code (for example administrators)

All these parameters are set when you add an attribute of IB Captcha
datatype, not in configuration ini file, so it is much more convenient
to use. We should also note that the color is set using convenient
colopicker.
Another advantages of IB Captcha is that you need to enter secret code
only once per registration process. For example you entered right
secret code, but with wrong e-mail, than you don't need to retype
secret code again, only you e-mail. Also IB Captcha is not displayed
while editing objects, only when they are first created.


3. Setup process
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation is very simple: you have to unpack the downloaded archive
ibcaptcha_1.0.zip to an extension folder. After that, you need to activate
IB Captcha extension in the administrative panel: Setup -> Extensions.
Also you need to regenerate the autoload array.
After that a new IB Captcha datatype will apear in your system.

Now you can add the attribute of this type in any of the classes. For example
if you add it to the user class, IB Captcha will apear in registration
process. Note: that when adding Collected Info attribute in the class
(feedback form, etc.) you should check "Collect Information" checkbox.
