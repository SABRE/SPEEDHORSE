Getting eZ publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/download/all_releases/ez_publish_3_stable_releases

Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/installation


Installing Topdrop extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary depends on the file you 
   downloaded.
   [tar]:
   $ tar -xvvf topdrop.tar

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the 
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add)
   the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=topdrop

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/<siteaccess_name>/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=topdrop
   
   You can also activate the extension through the admin interface, in Setup/Extentions.
   Just make the extension active by checking the checkbox, and validate with the Apply Changes button.
   Caution : activate the extension through the admin interface will activate it for all siteaccess.

4. Patching the pagelayout.tpl
   In order to call the menu, you need to patch the pagelayout.tpl file
   Replace  
<div id="topmenu" class="float-break">
   {include uri='design:menu/flat_top.tpl'}
</div>
   By 
 <div class="float-break">
     {menu name=TopMenu}
 </div>

5. Clear the cache....

6. Tune your menu.
   Each fetch has a filter like class_filter_array, array(1)
   This will only display folders
   In eZwebin, replace by class_filter_array, array(1,19,20,31) to get all needed classes.

   This parameter can be configured level by level

   Overflow direction
   A multi level menu on the right of a webpage might go out of the screen. To prevent it, topdrop has a parameter that tell the sub menu if it should expand on the left or on the right
   In settings/design.ini.append.php you will find a goleft setting
   goleft=4 means that the first 4 menu will drop on the right, while the next will drop on the left.
