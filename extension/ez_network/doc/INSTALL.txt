eZ Network Client installation instructions
============================================
You should be in possession of the eZ Network tarball before you begin this procedure, given to you by an eZ representative.


------------
Introduction
------------
If you have any problems while installing, please read the eZ Network FAQ in the doc/ directory before contacting the eZ representative.

See the definitions at the end of this file, if you have problems understanding the instructions.

IMPORTANT: If you are attempting to install eZ Network on a copy of a site, please refer to section "Installing a on a duplicate site"

------------
Requirements
------------
These are the requirements for the eZ Network extension:
* Official eZ Publish Enterprise requirements (http://ez.no/ezpublish/requirements)
* Access to GNU patch command (required for patching service)
* Access to GNU diff command (optional)
* Outbound connection access to critmon1.ez.no:443

------------------
Installation steps
------------------
Note that the installation procedure includes a part where you must wait for a message from your eZ representative before you can continue.


1. eZ Network extension Setup
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1.1 The tarball must be extracted in the "extension/" directory.
The tarball will override the directory "ez_network/".

Remember to remove the "ez_network/" directory before you extract the files, if it already exists.

1.2 Enable the extension by adding it to the ActiveExtension list in settings/override/site.ini.append.php
[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveExtensions[]=ez_network

1.3 Regenerate autoload array
Check the eZ Publish docs for your version on how this is done.
Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click on the button there.


2. Certifying the installation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.1 From ezroot, with your php CLI executable, run the script "extension/ez_network/scripts/certify.php".
This script will generate a log file in ezroot, named "certify.log".

 If you get a "An unexpected error has occurre" error, try running the script with your default siteacces:
 php extension/ez_network/scripts/certify.php -s <siteaccess>

 If you get something like "Warning: mysql_connect(): (28000/1045): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'":
 Make sure you have correct [DatabaseSettings] in settings/override/site.ini.append.php or in all valid siteaceeses.


2.2 You must now send the file to your eZ representative for analysis and wait for a response before your continue the installation procedure.
If the response is that you need to resolve some issues, then do so, and repeat point 2 until the response from the analysis is positive.
If the response is positive, you can move on to the next step.


3. Initialize the eZ Network application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This script will initialize the database ( create the necessary database tables ), and log MD5 sums of eZ Publish files to the database ++.
If you have received a predefined installation key (a string of 32 characters), then go to 3.1.a, if not, then goto 3.1.b.

3.1.a. From ezroot, run the script "extension/ez_network/scripts/initialize.php" with the --installationkey parameter like this:
php extension/ez_network/scripts/initialize.php --installationkey=<installation_key>

3.1.b. From ezroot, run the script "extension/ez_network/scripts/initialize.php" like this:
php extension/ez_network/scripts/initialize.php
At the end of the script execution, it will print the "installation ID" (Also referred to as a "installation key") to standard output.
This value must be sent to eZ Systems as it is a unique identifier for this installation


4.Set up the cronjobs
+++++++++++++++++++++
The initialize script creates a file called nw_crontab.txt that contains the list of cronjobs that must be set up.
You may modify the intervals as you choose but please follow these recommendations:

4.1. sync_network � updates the client with the latest monitors and patches.
This cronjob part will download and install the latest monitors from ez.no. It will also download new patches ( but not install them ).
This cronjob can for example be run every 8 hours. ( 24:00, 08:00, 16:00 )

4.2. monitor � runs the monitor, and uploads the result to support.ez.no (via critmon1.ez.no)
The results of the monitor is uploaded to support.ez.no once all the monitors have been run. If the upload fails, it'll try to upload the result the next time.
This cronjob can be run every 5 minutes.

4.3. patch � installs the patches on the client.
This cronjob part will install the patch at the client, and send an update to ez.no with the status of how the installation went.
This cronjob part may cause large system loads, and should only be run when the server is not being heavily accessed ( example, 03:00 am )
The cronjobs might not start working immediately as information has to propagate between the different servers involved in the eZ Network system.

Note:
That the sync_network cronjob has to be run successfully before the other crons will work.
If you ran the initialize script with a key provided to you, then you should be able to connect to the eZ Network system right away.
If you did not run the initialize script with a provided installation key, but instead sent the key generated by the script, to eZ,
then you need to wait until the key has propagated throughout the eZ Network system.
When the key has been entered into the system, the propagation may take an hour to complete.
When this is take place, the sync_network cronjob should be able to connect to the eZ Network system.


On *nix platforms:
------------------
To access the cronjob list (crontab), execute the command "crontab -e -u [crontab user]".
For more information about the crontab, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab.

On Windows platforms:
---------------------
To access the Windows task scheduler interface, following this sequence:
Start->All Programs->Accessories->System Tools->Scheduled Tasks
For more information on how to use it, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Tasks

--------------------------------
Installing a on a duplicate site
--------------------------------
If you are setting up a copy of a site that is already running eZ Network,
you have to remove the eZ Network Installation ID from its database before you run the eZ Network cronjobs.
The Installation ID has to be unique per installation.

Typical situations where you want to install eZ Network on a copy of a web site, is staging servers, test servers, live servers, and so on.

This is where you locate and remove the Installation ID:
1. Access your database
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Refer to the manual for your database.

2. Locate the Installation ID
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
select value from ezsite_data where name='ezpublish_site_id';
+----------------------------------+
| value                            |
+----------------------------------+
| 3ac8afd225280b93be31e93f953bdb51 |
+----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)

3. Remove the Installation ID+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
delete from ezsite_data where name='ezpublish_site_id';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)

Now you can start the installation process, which will provide you with a unique Installation ID.
