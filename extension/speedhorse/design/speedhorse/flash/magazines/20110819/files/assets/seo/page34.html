        <span class="">Aside from the 10 mph headwinds and the heat, it was a perfect day for racing at Fair Meadows on July 22. The temperatures had dropped slightly from the 104 degree high by the time Junglebell stepped into the one-hole for the $15,000 Tulsa State Fair Mixed Stakes. Runaway Argus, with two wins to his credit in 2011, was favored to win, with Junglebell going off at 5:1 odds as the second most popular entry. Regular rider Mario Chavez guided the three-year-old flly into the one-hole with her nemesis Runaway Argus coming from the seven-hole. Crazy Mother Trucker came out on top with Junglebell a close </span>

        <span class="">Sumokin and BV Eye Am First were touted to be the ones to beat in the Cherokee Nation Stakes at Fair Meadows on July 22. The duo had two wins each to their credit in their freshman campaigns. Sumokin had nailed her trial heat to the Black Gold Derby at Fair Meadows, but came up short in the fnals on June 29. She also won her trial heat to the Easy Jet Stakes at Remington, but fnished ffth in </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">gray flly Sumokin was there to give the competition a run for its money. Kenny Muntz, who had been in the irons for Sumokin for the entire 2011 season, was up for the Cherokee Nation. Sumokin broke alertly in third, but BV Eye </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">Am First looked like he might pull off a perfect victory as he came out on top and held the lead nearly the entire distance. Win Rabbits Fly was also making a bid as he popped out in second and held on to his position throughout most of the 350-yard distance. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Sumokin, however, pushed out by a head at the wire to take the $13,088 paycheck for owners and breeders Corner K Quarter Horses. Veteran trainer Luis Villafranco met his charge in the winner’s circle for the photo shoot. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Sumokin covered the 350-yards in :17.74 for an 88 speed index on a fast track against a ten mph head wind. The win </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">brought her earnings to $89,752 with a 3-0-0 record from six. Finishing second was BV Eye Am First (Mr Eye Opener-Lady Telia) owned by Hipolito Pina, trained by Jose Martinez-Rocha and ridden by Berkley Packer. In third was Win Rabbits Fly (Fly Jess Fly-Break The Market) owned by Phil Caddell, trained by Derrell Giddens and ridden by Pedro Martinez. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The remaining order of fnish was Rowdy Suspect (Ausual Suspect-Miss Karely Rose), Small Town Famous (Country Chicks Man-Veleveteena), Perks Prime Oak Tree (Oak Tree Special-Perks Prime Plus), Black Rosalita (Sweet First Down-Poneta), and Enough Rocket (Royal Quick Rocket-Effort Enough).
