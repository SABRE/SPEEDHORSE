        <span class="">When you’re 106 years old, victories are even sweeter, friendships are more precious and good horses are more appreciated. “I can truthfully say we owe a lot of our success to our trainer, Monty Arossa,” said Denny Weigt, who is half of the Weigt racing team in Jerome, Idaho. The other half is his partner and wife, Sandy. “Monty has not only been a great trainer, but he’s a good friend. Whenever we go to the track and there are some kids around he asks them, ‘Have you ever seen someone 106 years old?’ They always shake their heads and then he points at me. ‘That old man over there is.’ I’m not quite that old, I’m just 78, but it makes me laugh. “We work as a team from start to fnish. Monty looks at the catalogues and picks out horses he thinks will ft the program and then points them out to me and how much he thinks we should pay for them. “That’s the way it was with Illtacmanhattan. We both saw her in the Pacifc Coast catalogue and liked her. We were looking for a Tac It Like a Man baby and she was gorgeous. Of course, sometimes you see a picture and like a horse and they aren’t as impressive when you see them in person, but she had other things going for her also. Her female line is </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">impeccable. I think most people would have bought her based on that alone. “We got to the sale and she was even better than her pictures. There wasn’t anything not to like about her. Some horses are overbalanced one way or the other, but on her, everything just ft. There was a lot of interest in her, but we got her bought for $20,000. Afterwards, people came by and asked if I got anything bought and I told them hip 292. Everyone had noticed her. Lin Melton said, ‘Man did I ever like her.’ Everyone did. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“A lot of people come up to us and tell us how lucky we are and I tell them we aren’t lucky, we </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">work hard. Monty breaks the colts to ride and then we put them on the chariots and drive them all winter. He’s been a World Champion chariot racer twice, so he loves it anyway, but it give us an edge because we have the babies going long before most other people do. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Sandy convinced me to get rid of the mares fve years ago because I was just getting to old to stay up with them all night </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">when they were foaling. That was probably our best decision. We just buy babies now, but that doesn’t mean we don’t still work. It doesn’t matter if we have a blizzard blowing or not. I go out and hook them up and off we go. While a lot of others </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">are sitting around watching football, I’m out driving the colts and I think it shows when we go to the track in the spring. They’re in better shape and they’re more mature.” Illtacmanhattan is the perfect combination of breeding, conformation, conditioning and a winning team effort. The two-year-old bay flly won her frst attempt with a handy two-length lead. That maiden race was her only non-stakes effort and she quickly settled into the program her connections set out for her. On April 30 she won her trial heat to the Beehive at Laurel Brown and came back on May 28 to win the fnals with a 100 speed index. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Sandy Downs was next on her agenda, where she won her trial heat to the Sandy Downs Juvenile Challenge on June 11 and came back to win the fnals by a head with a 101 speed index. </span>
