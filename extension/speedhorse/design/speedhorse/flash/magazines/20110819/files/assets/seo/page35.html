        <span class="">Snip N Dale continues to cut a successful swath through the Pacific Northwest. The six-year-old gelding claimed his sixth stakes victory, winning the $15,500 Jack Rhoden Memorial Handicap on July 17 at Crooked River Roundup. Five of Snip N Dale’s stakes triumphs are registered in the state of Oregon, including the past two versions of the Jack Rhoden Handicap. The overwhelming favorite at the betting window, Snip N Dale broke from the two-gate running third but held the advantage at each remaining call of the 250-yard sprint. The gelding led L Bar D Snow Princes by a head going into the stretch, then widened the gap to reach the wire with a 1 1/2-length separation. Prepped by trainer Scott Raley, Snip N Dale covered the 250-yards in 13.270 seconds, exactly matching his time from the 2010 Jack Rhoden, which set an NTR at that </span>
